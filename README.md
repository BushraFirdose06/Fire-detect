- *What we have?*
IoT Fire Alerting System using Arduino & SIM900A," is an innovative fire detection system designed to provide real-time alerts when a fire is detected. Unlike traditional fire alarms that only sound within a building, our system sends SMS alerts and makes phone calls to emergency contacts, ensuring immediate response.

It is built using affordable and widely available components, including an Arduino Uno, a Flame Sensor, and a SIM900A GSM Module, making it cost-effective, scalable, and independent of internet connectivity.

By providing instant remote alerts, our project can help reduce fire damage, save lives, and improve emergency response times in homes, offices, and industries.

*What Makes our Project Unique?*

Traditional alarms: Only local alerts .
Our system: Remote alerts via SMS & Phone Call 

Key Differentiators:
 Real-time detection (Immediate response)
 Phone Call Alerts (Ensures attention even if SMS is missed)
 Cost-effective (Affordable components)
 No Internet Dependency (Works anywhere GSM is available)
Scalable (Can be expanded for industrial, residential, or rural areas)

Our system is smart, fast, and accessible, ensuring instant fire alerts via SMS and phone calls for quick action anytime, anywhere—no internet needed!
 With minimal setup and maximum impact, we’re making fire safety smarter and more efficient than ever. 

"Prevention is better than cure!"
